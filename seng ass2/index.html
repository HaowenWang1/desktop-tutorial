			<li><h3>Tanjung Lesung, The Place to Layback and Immerse in the Beauty of Nature</h3>
				<br>
				<img src="001.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="left" alt="wrong">
				<p class="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;Located on Java’s most western coast in the district of Pandeglang in the province of Banten, the Tanjung Lesung resembles the Lesung, which in the local Sundanese language means the receptacle for rice pounding. Tanjung Lesung is a developing integrated beach resort for recreation and hotels overlooking Mt Anak Krakatu, all that is left of the once-mighty Krakatau volcano. This huge 1,500 hectares area of Tanjung Lesung has been developed by the Banten West Java Tourism Development Corporation (BWJ) since 1996, patterned after the famed Nusa Dua Resort in Bali. The resort is envisaged to contain top range hotels and restaurants, a convention hall, a number of golf courses, marina and theme park.</p><br><br><br><a href="https://www.indonesia.travel/sg/en/destinations/java/serang/tanjung-lesung">Click here to know more</a>

			<li><h3>Mauritius all inclusive holidays</h3>
				<br>
				<img src="004.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="left" alt="wrong">
				<p class="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure white sands, sparkling turquoise waters and luxury beachfront retreats on Mauritius rival some of the best in the world.

			<li><h3>Sri Lanka all inclusive holidays</h3>
				<br>
				<img src="005.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="left" alt="wrong">
				<p class="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;  On a stunning coconut-fringed coastline lapped by the Indian Ocean, the tiny tear drop shaped island of Sri Lanka lies just beneath India and is surrounded by natural beauty, friendly people, sacred Buddhist temples and emerald green paddy fields. 

				If you’re thinking about a Sri Lanka holiday it’s well worth going all inclusive. Many of the hotels are set within pretty but tiny villages, beachfront, on tea plantations or in verdant forest, and often, there’s not that many places to eat and drink outside of your hotel. Known as the ‘pearl of the Indian Ocean’ you’ll certainly want to get out and explore the lush rainforests, golden beaches and national parks, so an all-inclusive package means you also have plenty of time to hang out at the pool bar and enjoy wallet-free dining and drinks too. </p><br><br><br><a href="https://www.kuoni.co.uk/sri-lanka/sri-lanka-all-inclusive-holidays">Click here to know more</a>

				<br>
				<img src="006.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="left" alt="wrong">
				<p class="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s sun-kissed luxury in the Med, beach bliss on the Turquoise Coast or family fun on the Canary Islands, we offer a range of all-inclusive Europe holidays. 
				Halkidiki’s IKOS Olivia is redefining European all-inclusive with its Infinite Lifestyle concept.
