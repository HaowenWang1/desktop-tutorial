			 	<h3>My thoughts on the test results</h3>
			 	<p>The test results point out that I am an introverted person, but I am willing to help others. In reality, I do that too. In some respects, I donâ€™t really believe in these tests. I think people encounter different things in different situations,There will be different behaviors, and this is not a conclusion that can be drawn by doing a problem.
				In the team, I prefer to be an executor, if necessary, I can also be a leader to make plans and arrange work.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>My project idea was to build a medical app, but instead of simple, mechanical medical advice, it would be a more useful, efficient and comprehensive medical system. Of course, basic functions will be available, such as inputting information about the user's body fat, and the app will calculate the amount of daily activity required and the user's basal metabolic rate in order to allocate the amount of protein, fat and carbohydrates needed to eat each day. The app will also provide information on possible medical conditions when the user is experiencing abnormal symptoms and will work with a number of health care providers to enable the user to apply to speak to a medical professional to see if further treatment is necessary, which will save time when visiting a doctor.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>Why I wanted to build an app with such functionality, I will explain here. First of all, physical health is becoming more and more important in our age of over nutrition, we don't have to think about survival, so I want people to think more about physical health, especially in countries like Australia for example, where food is cheap, especially fried food and fast food, which are delicious but they are actually very harmful to the human body, according to the information I know, about thirty percent of the Australian According to my information, about 30 per cent of adults in Australia are obese or above normal, which can lead to diseases such as high blood pressure, which this software will help prevent. Secondly, although Australia has some of the best medical care in the world, it is very difficult to communicate with a medical professional, and this app will hopefully work with some medical institutions so that you can communicate with your doctor in real time from home, and the software will integrate both parties into one database so that they can better understand each other's situation during the communication process.</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>Firstly, when the user downloads the app for the first time (the app is free for the user and revenue is generated through advertising and medical partnerships), the app asks the user to create an account and fill in some personal information, as follows: nickname, gender, email address, contact number, age, height, weight, country, home address (optional), previous illnesses (if any), and from Where did you find out about this software? After filling in the basic information, it will be stored in a database so that it can be investigated at any time. Once you have entered the app, you will be given several options: fitness, life, check for symptoms, treatment of symptoms and communication with your own doctor. Each option has a different function. For the fitness function, similar to traditional fitness apps, the user will need to fill in body fat and whether they have had any physical problems, and the app will give them some options based on their physical condition. Of course, users can also just skip this item, in which case the software will offer mass fitness options. The options include fat loss, muscle building and body recovery. Each of these options will offer a different fitness programme, including running, swimming, etc. The software will arrange different exercise cycles according to the body's condition, following these cycles will achieve the best results, the same goes for muscle building, with anaerobic exercises such as stretching and weight lifting. Body recovery is different from the first two, it is for special people who have diseases or organ damage, the main exercise is to recover the body. Lifestyle options are integrated into the user's basic lifestyle, such as diet and sleep, and how the daily diet should be matched, for example if the user has high blood pressure, then the daily salt intake should be adjusted. The Sleep function is a daily sleep survey that calculates the amount of sleep the user gets to restore their fitness. The physical symptom check is a question and answer function based on the user's physical discomfort, if the user is suffering from discomfort based on this function, such as headache etc. The questions will be asked based on the question bank, starting with basic questions and going in depth slowly, just like a doctor's consultation, which will eventually lead to a general range of problems, which may of course be common problems such as lack of rest. Physical symptom treatment is how to address the user's physical ailments and which ones should be treated with what medication. Communication with an exclusive doctor, some physical problems can be communicated and consulted directly with the doctor to get the most authoritative answers. The app will cooperate with some hospitals or medical institutions to have online consultations with patients. Patients will need to book an appointment in advance and the app will provide information about the doctor. The doctor will also use the database to get information about the patient and give good solutions, and will remind the patient to go to hospital for further tests if necessary.

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>The app will create an official website on the internet and will use HTML, CSS, Javascript, Flash and other software. The software will be developed on mobile phones using Java and Objective-C</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>I believe that the skills required to develop software are the most basic programming languages (C/C++/JAVA etc.), database technologies (SQL/ORACLE/DB2 etc.), .NET platform technologies, C, C/S B/S program development, and many more such as JAVA SCRIPT, AJAX, HIBERNATE, SPRING, J2EE, WEB SERVICE, STRUCTS and other cutting-edge technologies.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>If the project is successful, I will need to consider a number of issues, which include maintenance of the software, updating of the database, and optimisation of functionality. The software will solve many people's problems in accessing health care, and convert the doctor's consultation from offline to online, which will greatly improve the efficiency of access to health care. For many people living in remote areas, they will also be able to manage their illnesses and recover from them with a mobile phone.</p>
